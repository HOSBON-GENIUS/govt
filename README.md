### 1. Prerequisites
- XAMPP/WAMP installed (Apache + MySQL)

CREATE DATABASE govt_db;
-- Then import tables (project, comment, media, user, etc.)
```

### 3. Configure Database
Edit `config.php`:
```php
$host = 'localhost';
$db = 'govt_db';
$user = 'root';
$pass = ''; // or your MySQL password
```

## Testing

## Deployment
When ready, upload the entire `govt` folder to your web host (e.g., Bluehost) under `public_html/`, import the database, and update credentials in `config.php`.
